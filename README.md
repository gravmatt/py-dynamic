# Dynamic

Class to create dynamic objects.

## Installation

Install through **pip**.

```
$ pip install dynamic
```

or get from source

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gravmatt/py-dynamic.git
$ cd py-dynamic
$ python setup.py install
```

## Import module

Import the module into your python project.

```
from dynamic import Dynamic
```

## Usage

Create object when you need them.

```
me = Dynamic()
me.name = 'Rene'
me.username = 'gravmatt'

print '%s (%s)' % (me.name, me.username)

# Rene (gravmatt)
```

### Explicit Mode

By default the explicit is ON.

That means if you try to get a value that doesn't exists, a AttributeError get raised.

```
me = Dynamic()
me.name = 'Rene'

print me.age # age does not exist

# AttributeError: Property 'age' not found
```

You can turn the explicit mode off, by:

```
me = Dynamic(explicit=False)
me.name = 'Rene'

print 'My age:', me.age
# My age: None
```

Now when you try to access a property that doesn't exists, `None` get returned.
